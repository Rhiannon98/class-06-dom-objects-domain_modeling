            Salmon Cookies in the

            <img src = "images/cutter.jpg">
            of a <span id = "img4">salmon!!!!</span>
            <img src = "images/chinook.jpg"> And actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the <italic>ideal</italic> match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever. Tourists will go gaga for them, locals will begrudgingly fall in <strong>love</strong> with them, and Pat will make a ton of them.</p>

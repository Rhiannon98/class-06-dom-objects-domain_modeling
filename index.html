          <h3>What we do</h3>
            <p>Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. </br>

            They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever. Tourists will go gaga for them, locals will begrudgingly fall in love with them, and Pat will make a ton of these.</p>
